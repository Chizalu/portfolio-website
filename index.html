      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a student who is just starting out in web development.
        As a beginner, I am learning the fundamentals of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I am passionate about understanding how websites are built and how to make them interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
        
        I’m excited to explore various aspects of web development, from front-end design to back-end functionality. My goal is to combine creativity with problem-solving to develop websites that stand out and provide value to users.
        
        While I’m currently focusing on mastering the basics, I am always curious to learn about new tools, frameworks, and trends in the tech world. I believe that each project I take on will not only help me improve my skills but also allow me to discover my unique style as a developer.
        
        I’m eager to continue growing, embracing challenges, and staying motivated as I work toward becoming a skilled web developer. This journey is just the beginning, and I’m excited to see where it takes me!</p>
